# Examples of using dask to analyze LEFTFIELD MCMC outputs

This repository contains examples showing how to use dask to speed up the analysis of MCMC samples produced by the EFT-forward-modeling code LEFTFIELD.

The LEFTFIELD code has been developed at MPA -- by Fabian Schmidtâ€™s research group -- for (Bayesian) cosmological inference at the field-level using an EFT-based forward-modeling approach. The list of analyses using the code is kept up-to-date below:
